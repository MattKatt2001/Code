#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#For all numbers that are less than 1000 but are multples of 3 or 5 we add them to an array
#We then sum the array elements

while 0 < i:
